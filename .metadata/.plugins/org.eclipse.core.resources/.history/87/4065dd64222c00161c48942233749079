We are going to create a Shape interface and concrete classes implementing
the Shape interface. A factory class ShapeFactory is defined as a next step.

FactoryPatternDemo, our demo class, will use ShapeFactory to get a Shape object.
It will pass information (CIRCLE / RECTANGLE / SQUARE) to ShapeFactory to get 
the type of object it needs.

Step 1
Create an interface.

Step 2
Create concrete classes implementing the same interface.

Step 3
Create a Factory to generate object of concrete class based on given information.
